End of February 2023 I was fortunate enough to got asked to present a programming topic at the SAE Institute in Cologne in front of a bunch of game programming students.
I presented them with a couple of topics, namely "Emulation Of Retro Consoles", "Low Level Optimization" and "Foundation Of Custom Game Engine Development". The students had a few days to vote and it seems like they unanimously voted to hear about "Low Level Optimization" - a topic very near and dear to my heart.

The presentation was held on April 1st and I wanted to use this blog post to share the slides with anyone who's interested.

The slides can be downloaded here:
