## Summary
In this post I'll go into detail about how, during my contracting work for [Shimmer Industries](https://www.shimmerindustries.com/) (a company founded by Eskil Steenberg which is focused on developing a real-time lighting designing software) I worked on a piece of software which enabled us to use the MacOS and iOS APIs using a custom C API without having to use Objective-C (ObjC).

## "Why would you do this? Just use Objective-C!!!11"
Let me start this post by saying that yes, we could've used ObjC to be able to use the MacOS and iOS APIs (referred to as "Apple APIs" from this point forward) from within the C codebase that was already in place. We decided against it though, because we wanted to have a pure C codebase without any of the weird[^1] ObjC code in there. We didn't want maintainers (who are all mostly familiar with C) to first learn how to parse ObjC and also thought that this would be a cool thing that might also interesting other developers. It was certainly an interesting experience for me since outside some courses in University, I've never touched a OSX or iOS development and was also unfamiliar with ObjC and XCode as an IDE.

## Introducing the Objective-C runtime
Eskil actually gave me the first hint by pointing me towards the ObjC runtime.

Quoting the official documentation it states that "The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language"[^2]. This sounds interesting, but slighty vague, so after taking a closer look at the documentation and the API itself, to see if there's stuff in there that could be of use for solving this problem, I was delighted to see that there's stuff like "give me a list of all classes and methods" and, most importantly "call the function with a given name on this object". Bingo, this is exactly what I was looking for and seems to be a good foundation to build a C API on. Even better: The ObjC runtime itself is even a pure C API! To test my working theory, I coded up this small simple sample to see if this worked.

## The plan
The overall plan is to have a C API which, under the hood, uses the ObjC runtime to call functions that are normally only accessible when programming in ObjC.

In praxis this would mean that ObjC code like this:
```objc
char* getClipboardString()
{
  UIPasteboard pasteBoard = [UIPasteboard generalPasteboard];
  NSString pasteBoardContent = [pasteBoard string];

  NSUInteger length = [pasteBoardContent lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
  char* pString = (char*)malloc(length);

  [pasteBoardContent getCString:pString maxLength:length encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
  return pString;
}
```

could be written like this in C:
```c
char* getClipboardString()
{
  uipasteboard_t pasteBoard = uipasteboard_generalPasteboard();
  nsstring_t pasteBoardContent = uipasteboard_string( pasteBoard );

  unsigned long length = nsstring_lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding( pasteBoardContent, NSUTF8StringEncoding );
  char *cStr = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * (uint)length);
  nsstring_getCString(pasteBoardContent, cStr, length, NSUTF8StringEncoding);

  return cStr;
}
```

It was clear pretty early on that we'd need some kind of external code-generation tool that would use the ObjC runtime to parse the ObjC APIs and use the parsed information to generate the C API. 

## The code generator
Let's get right into it and talk about the code generator.
From a birds-eye-view the code generator is a command-line tool (written in C) which uses the ObjC runtime API to query various data from ObjC APIs and uses this queried data to generate multiple .c/.h files which can be used in a project to interface with these ObjC APIs using normal C functions.

For each ObjC class that you want to create a C API for, the tool basically does these things in order:
![Code Generator Workflow](/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/code_generator_workflow.png)
_Code Generator Workflow_

### Query ObjC Class
The first step is to query metadata about the class that we're interested in turning into a C API.
The code generator works by providing it with a one or more ObjC class name(s) (optionally including wildcards). For each class the generator generates a pair of .c/.h files.

This is done by first querying for *all* available classes using `objc_getClassList()`[^3]. The query results will be returned using an opaque type `Class` which can be used together with `class_` prefixed functions to query more metadata about a specific class.
So the generator first caches all available classes (I'll later talk about how classes are made visible for the ObjC runtime API) and then compares the name of each class (by using `class_getName()`[^4]) against the input of the user.

Once one ore more matching classes have been found, we move to the next step.

### Flattening ObjC Class Hierarchy
ObjC is an object oriented language, C is not. So we need some way to map ObjC's "object orientness" to C functions.

For this problem I decided to flatten the class hierarchy of the class that you want to export to C.
This is done by using the `class_getSuperClass()`[^5] function from the ObjC Runtime API - this also returns an object of type `Class` - same as `objc_getClassList()` before.

For each class found during the "Query ObjC Class" step, the program needs to recursively move up the class hierarchy,
This is an image illustrating the class hierarchy for the class `NSMutableString`[^6]:
![Class Hierarchy of NSMutableString](/assets/img/posts/c_ocoa/class_hierarchy.png)
_Class Hierarchy of NSMutableString (The arrow point upwards the class hierarchy)_

Unlike C++, ObjC does *not* support multiple inheritance (thank god!), so this process is rather straight-forward.

By using `class_getSuperClass()`, we can recursively go up the class hierarchy and query the methods of each individual class.
Querying the methods of a class is done using the `class_copyMethodList()`[^7] API - this returns an array of the opaque type `Method` which can be used to query metadata about a specific method.

The result of this step is an array of methods from the complete class hierarchy. Spoiler: Since we'll later call the methods using just their name, we don't have to worry about methods that's have been overriden at this point.

> *Note*: This works for only for *non-static* methods. To also get the *static* methods of a class you have to get what's called the `MetaClass`. This is done by using the `object_getClass()`[^8] function with a `Class` object as it's argument. This returns another object of type `Class`. This object can be used together with `class_copyMethodList()` to get the list of static methods.

The result of this step are 2 arrays:
1. Array of all *static* methods
2. Array of all *non-static* methods

### Resolving ObjC Runtime Types
Before talking about how the metadata of methods is queried, I have to talk about how types are encoded in the ObjC runtime.

When querying argument and/or return types using the ObjC runtime you "only" get back a string. Naively I though that this is just the name of the return type (eg: `int`, `float` or `NSString`) but things are a bit more complicated than that.
Basically we have to differentiate between base types (`int`, `char`, `float` etc), user defined POD(plain-old-data) types (your typical structs), references (pointers) and ids (more on that later). For each of these types, the type name from the ObjC runtime has to be parsed differently.

#### Base Types
Let's start with the most simple - base types. Instead of fully qualified type names (like `int`), the ObjC runtime returns a string with 1 element.
Fortunately, there's a 1:1 mapping between these "ObjC base types" and "C base types". The mapping listed below is from the `objc/runtime.h`[^11] file

```objc
#define _C_CHR      'c'
#define _C_UCHR     'C'
#define _C_SHT      's'
#define _C_USHT     'S'
#define _C_INT      'i'
#define _C_UINT     'I'
#define _C_LNG      'l'
#define _C_ULNG     'L'
#define _C_LNG_LNG  'q'
#define _C_ULNG_LNG 'Q'
#define _C_FLT      'f'
#define _C_DBL      'd'
#define _C_BFLD     'b'
#define _C_BOOL     'B'
#define _C_VOID     'v'
```

#### User defined structs
The next type, user defined POD types (struct XY) are a bit more complex. The ObjC runtime returns the type name and the complete layout of the custom type.
To drive home what I mean by this, think of a struct like this:
```objc
struct AwesomeType
{
  char a;
  int b;
  float c;
};
```

This type would be encoded by the ObjC runtime like this: `{AwesomeType=cif}`
With the info on how base types are encoded, the part after the equal sign can be parsed as a list of base types.
So this is basically `AwesomeType = char int float`.

This extends to structs within structs as well. So this struct:
```objc
struct Foo
{
  int a;
  unsigned int b;
  float c;
};

struct Boo
{
  double a;
  Foo foo;
};
```
Would result in this type name for `struct Boo`: `{Boo=d{Foo=iIf}}`.

> *Note*: The first version of the code generator actually re-created all structs that where used as return and argument types but as you might already have guessed, you loose the member name of each struct member. The current versions assumes that you use the actual ObjC struct (which are the same as C structs).

#### References
Following this, we have references which are marked with a `^` preceeding the encoded type name. This is thankfully quite easy to incorporate into the existing type parsing. Care should be taken with opaque types however since they'll be returned like this: `{OpaqueType=}` (For reference: Opaque types are types where the caller doesn't know the type layout).


#### ID
Finally, we have id - this is actually a type from the objc runtime API[^12].
This is a reference to an ObjC object, unfortunately for this we don't get any more type information. Looking at this from C, we basically only know that this is a `void*` and not what type.

### Collect ObjC Method Metadata
Now that it is established how the types are encoded, we can continue with querying metadata about each individual method.

After the class hierarchy has been flattened, we have generated a list of all methods of the complete class hierarchy.
In this step we use this list to query information about each individual method. Thinks that we're interested in include:
1. Method Name
2. Return Type
3. Number of Parameters
4. Type of Parameters

Since we now operate on objects of type `Method`, we can use the ObjC runtime functions prefixed with `method_`.
The first function that is being used is `method_getName()`[^9] - this is similar to `class_getName()` and returns a string.

The next function that we can use is `method_getReturnType()`[^10] this returns an ObjC runtime encoded type string (that we know how to parse thanks to [the previous chapter](#resolving-objc-runtime-types)).
To get the parameter list, `method_getNumberOfArguments()`[^13] together with `method_getArgumentType()`[^14] can be used. The returned type is also encoded as an ObjC runtime type.

Unfortunately the name of the arguments can not be queried.
